# Data Analysis and Visualization

| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| üí° [Telecommunications Customer Segmentation]() | R, Tableau, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Segmentation, Business Analytics | Conducted a comprehensive segmentation and profiling analysis for a telecommunications company to support effective customer retention strategies. Utilized Value Segmentation and Decision Tree Segmentation techniques to uncover actionable insights into customer behavior, guiding targeted retention initiatives tailored to maximize customer engagement, loyalty, and long-term profitability. | 
| üîé [Data De-identification](https://github.com/adelinecasali4/Data-Analysis/tree/0b4aefecc34a033798817920ab2f627fff5fa4cc/Data%20De-identification) | R, Data Privacy, Data Governance | Conducted a comprehensive risk assessment for a company's customer survey dataset to evaluate the potential for customer re-identification. Utilized probabilistic algorithms and scientific principles across four scenarios, determining acceptable risk levels for deliberate attacks and data breaches but identifying unacceptable risk levels for inadvertent and demonstration attacks, with recommendations provided to mitigate identified risks. |
